# Advent of Code 2023 üéÑ

My code for the annual Advent of Code Competition.

I've never competed before, but I'm having a lot of fun so far. I'm using this as an opportunity to refine my competitive coding skills while also enjoying myself. This is also a great opportunity for me to get even more comfortable working in different languages.

## Favorite Problems
03\. [Gear Ratios](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)\
04\. [Scratchcards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4)\
07\. [Camel Card](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7)\
14\. [Parabolic Reflector Dish](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/14)\
15\. [Lens Library](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/15) (Wonderful problem to do in C)\
18\. [Lavaduct Lagoon](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/18) (I learned somthing new ü§©)\
19\. [Aplenty](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/19) (Part one was a lot of fun)\
20\. [Pulse Propagation](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/20) (Part one was fun, part two was not)

## The Problems I Struggled the most on
10\. [Pipe Maze](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/10) (My code may look ugly, but it works)\
12\. [Hot Springs](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/12) (Thank you [Calvin](https://github.com/HalflingHelper) ‚ù§Ô∏è)\
17\. [Clumsy Crucible](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/17) (I love not going over my code to check that the numbers are correct üòä)

## Side Note
Please don't ask why I did it in python
I feel disgusted with myself. ü§Æ \
Nvm I'm doing this in a bunch of languages now!!!

Rant about Day 20: I really disliked how we were expected to map out what the input was. I think that was extremely unintuitive, and not what these coding problems should be about. The problems should require general solutions for any kind of input. This problem required that the input be designed in a specific way for the player to find the correct answer in a short amount of computation time. 

Java is bae üòç \
All my homies hate python  

Enjoy my code! üòé

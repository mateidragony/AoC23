# Advent of Code 2023 🎄

My code for the annual Advent of Code Competition.

I've never competed before, but I'm having a lot of fun so far. I'm using this as an opportunity to refine my competitive coding skills while also enjoying myself. This is also a great opportunity for me to get even more comfortable working in different languages.

## Favorite Problems
03\. [Gear Ratios](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)\
04\. [Scratchcards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4)\

## Side Note

I feel disgusted with myself. 🤮 \
Nvm I'm doing this in a bunch of languages now!!!

All my homies hate python
